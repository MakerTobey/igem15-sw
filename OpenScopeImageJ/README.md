# ImageJ Plugin for OpenScope
To use:

Unzip the openscope_imagej.zip file in your plugins folder where ImageJ is installed.

After restarting ImageJ, you should see an openscope entry in your plugins menu! Enter your settings first and then you will be able to connect and operate the microscope, while importing images directly into imagej.
